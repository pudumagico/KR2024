5. Answer Representation.

The answer computed by the theory will always be in a predicate of the form 'ans(X)', where 'X' is the expected answer.
'X' can be a boolean, yes or no, it can be an attribute, it can be a relation or the value of some attribute.

Examples of these are:
ans(yes)
ans(red)
ans(man)
ans(left)
ans(pose)
