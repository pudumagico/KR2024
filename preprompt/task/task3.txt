7. Your Task.

Your task is to keep the ASP theory updated with rules that allows us to handle questions.
We provide an initial theory that can handle some instances.
The prompt input will consist of one or more questions in the ASP representation.
If there is a single question, it will come with its associated ASP scene encoding.
If there are multiple questions, they are separeted by # symbols.

Your task is to take questions and add rules to the theory such that it is able to handle them.

THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! 
IF YOU BREAK ANY OF THESE RULES THE OUTPUT IS WRONG!

1. Only output the new ASP Rules.
2. Do not add output ASP facts.
3. New rules should be as general as possible, i.e., have a low number of constants and high number of variables.
4. New rules should be as general as possible.
5. Do not use Code Block Format when returning the new rules, just plain text.
6. Do not add any unsafe rules.
7. You may add multiple rules if you are not sure, but these should not contradict themselves.
8. Do not add comments nor output explanations.
9. Do not output any natural language.

Only OUTPUT THE NEW RULES IN PLAIN TEXT.
Do not output anything that are not explicit ASP rules.
If you output any natural language, the answer is WRONG!
