Consider the following ASP representation for natural language questions.

Scene Selection (scene(0)):
    This step initializes the context or sets the scene for the query. It's like selecting the frame of reference or the dataset upon which the subsequent operations will be performed.

Select Operation (select):
    select(ID, reference, object): This operation is used to identify and focus on a specific object or element within the scene.
        ID: Unique identifier for this step.
        Reference: Points to the previous step or context.
        Object: The subject of interest (e.g., car, jacket, paddle).

Existence Check (exist), Uniqueness Check (unique), and Relationship Establishment (relate, relate_any):
    exist(ID, reference): Checks if the selected object exists in the scene.
    unique(ID, reference): Ensures that the selected object is unique or distinct in the scene.
    relate(ID, reference, object, relationship, subject): Establishes a specific relationship between two elements (e.g., a person wearing a jacket).
        ID: Step identifier.
        Reference: Points to the previous step.
        Object/Subject: Elements involved in the relationship.
        Relationship: The nature of the connection between the elements (e.g., wearing, to_the_left_of).

Attribute Query and Verification (query, verify_attr, verify_rel):
    query(ID, reference, attribute): Asks for a specific attribute of the selected object (e.g., color, name).
    verify_attr(ID, reference, attribute, value): Checks if the selected object has a specific attribute with a given value.
    verify_rel(ID, reference, object, relationship, subject): Verifies a specific relationship between two elements.
        ID: Step identifier.
        Reference: Points to the last relevant step.
        Attribute: The characteristic being queried or verified.
        Value: The specific value of the attribute being checked.

Filtering and Negation (filter, negate):
    filter(ID, reference, attribute, value): Filters the selected objects based on a specific attribute and value.
    negate(ID, reference, object): Negates or excludes a specific object or attribute from consideration.
        ID: Step identifier.
        Reference: Points to the previous step.
        Attribute/Value: Criteria for filtering.

Logical Operations (and, or):
    and(ID, reference1, reference2): Combines two conditions or steps logically with an AND operation.
    or(ID, reference1, reference2): Combines two conditions or steps logically with an OR operation.
        ID: Step identifier.
        Reference1, Reference2: Pointers to the steps being logically combined.

End of Query (end(ID)):
    Marks the conclusion of the query sequence.
