Consider the following ASP representation for questions about objects.
It consists of a singular predicate 'question(X)', where 'X' represents a simple or composite question.
Simple questions are those composed by a singular predicate. Examples of these are:
question(above(obj(8,0,blue),obj(7,1,green))) 
question(right(obj(8,0,blue),obj(0,9,purple))) 
question(below(obj(0,9,purple),obj(8,0,blue))) 
Composite questions are those where the question is made of subquestions and composed by the connectives and, or, not.
For this we need to unpack the subquestions and solve them to solve the complete question. Examples of these are:
question(and(above(obj(8,0,blue),obj(4,4,orange)),right(obj(7,1,green),obj(0,9,purple))))
question(or(above(obj(8,0,blue),obj(4,4,orange)),below(obj(7,1,green),obj(8,0,blue))))
question(not(above(obj(8,0,blue),obj(4,4,orange))))
