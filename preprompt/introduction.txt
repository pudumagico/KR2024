1. Introduction
We are in the domain of Visual Question Answering.
The task consists of taking an image and question related to it as input and produce as output the correct answer.

We have already preprocessed both the image and question into correct Answer Set Programming representations.
Scene/Question pairs of ASP facts serve as the instance for an ASP program which we call the Theory.
This is a collection of rules that handles the input instance and calculates the correct answer.

Your task is to help us expand the Theory with new rules as new instances of questions appear.
We will first give you some definitions in the following sections and then present the concrete task.
