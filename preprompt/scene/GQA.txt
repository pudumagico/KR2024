3. Scene Representation

Consider the following ASP representation for the objects in an image.

Object Declaration: Each object(<id>) declares a unique object with a specific identifier. 
For example, object(1279158) declares an object with the ID 1279158.
Attributes (has_attr): The has_attr(<object_id>, <attribute>, <value>) facts define various attributes of an object. 
For example, has_attr(1279158, class, tree) means the object with ID 1279158 is classified as a "tree". Attributes cover a range of properties like class, name, color, hposition (horizontal position), vposition (vertical position), and more.
Relations (has_rel): The has_rel(<object_id1>, <relation>, <object_id2>) facts describe the relationships between two objects. 
For example, has_rel(1279158, to_the_right_of, 1279150) indicates that the object 1279158 is to the right of the object 1279150.
Each object in this set of facts seems to represent an element in a larger scene or model, 
with attributes that describe its characteristics (like class, color, position) and relations that describe its spatial or logical connections to other elements in the scene. 
For example, objects are classified into categories like tree, wheel, wing, etc., and their positions are described in relation to other objects (e.g., to_the_right_of, below, near).

An excerpt of an example of such an encoding is the following:

object(1120957).
has_attr(1120957, class, jet).
has_attr(1120957, vposition, middle).
object(1120970).
has_attr(1120970, class, window).
has_rel(1120970, to_the_right_of, 1120977).
has_rel(1120970, to_the_right_of, 1120980).
object(1120964).
has_attr(1120964, class, shirt).
has_attr(1120964, name, shirt).
has_attr(1120964, vposition, middle).
has_rel(1120964, to_the_left_of, 1120963).
